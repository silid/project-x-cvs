these are sample classes and not in use here.

these classes are subject to change by several implementations of additional disk access or similars, 
in accordance with the 'RawInterface.java'.

if the source access is read-only, don't forget to define a valid output directory in your system!

at the moment, it exists one Addon for read access of some topfield PVR disks..
you will get all the necessary files from the author of this.

there is no need to change anything, if such an access is not required.

if modified, replace the original (symbolical) classes before compiling, then recompile it all.
