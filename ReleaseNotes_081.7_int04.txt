Common
DVBSubpicture
MPAD
TS
X



changelog:
-fix: mpa audio decode exception on too much read Bits (wrong pointer in a corrupt frame)
-change: reject the 'more gop memory' from int03, seems not to free memory fast enough
-add: .sup creation from DVB-subpic: user colour table definitions possible (see "colours.tbl") (e.g. better anti-aliasing)
 * any additional defined table adds a menu item to the decoder model list, which overwrites the transmitted colour definitions
-add: simple packet/pid extraction out of a PVA,TS or PS,PES  -> new conversion item: "PIDfilter" (meant for special analyses)
 * copies the original packet from source to sink without any modification
 * use the PIDlist beside the preview to select one or more (P)ID for a limited extraction
