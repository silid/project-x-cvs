  <b><font size="+1">NAQs &amp; FAQs</font></b>
  <p><b>For those following the 'spirit' of Project X, who want to
learn more about this topic, we provide some loosely coupled thoughts
and tips which might be useful.</b> </p>
  <p><b>Further problems can only be solved if they are discussed in
the forum. Otherwise they might never be solved.<br>
  </b><b>The overwhelming presents of different hard- and software for
DVB recording might require settings which are different from the
standard</b><b> in Project X</b><b>.</b> <br>

  <p><b><font color="#009900">1.) I'm deaf and I want to transfer the
teletext-subtitles from a recorded broadcasting to a DVD.&nbsp;</font></b>
  </p>
  <p><u>Preconditions:</u> <br>
1) Subtitles are transmitted via teletext. (e.g. page 149,
150, 888, ...) <br>
2) The recording software must be capable to capture the Video-/Audio-
and Teletext stream without a change to one ore several files. <br>
3) The broadcasting company transmits the timestamps to synchronize the
texts with the picture. Not all of them are doing this or not
correctly! <br>
4) A DVD-Authoring application which is supporting subtitle formats. </p>
  <p><u>Walk through:</u> <br>
1) record the broadcast. <br>
2) load the file as one collection into Project X, where one or more
teletext files are given at the end. <br>
3) choose in the tab {teletext}the page(s) with the subtitles you want
(max. 6). <br>
Additionally you have to choose the output format according to your
authoring application. <br>
4) if necessary: set cut-point via {collection specials} and set
additional options. <br>
5) choose {demux} in the main window and push {Go}. <br>
6) author your new DVD with the created files.<br>
  </p>
  <p><u>Hint:</u> <br>
The easiest and best way for this purpose is the following processing
chain: record -&gt; Project X -&gt; ifoedit -&gt; DVD. <br>
The missing start menu is not important. </p>
  <p>before you start you have to set some properties and to check the
result: <br>
1) choose the format {SUP} in the tab {teletext} in Project X. Activate
{show preview} and choose a {Text font}. <br>
2) start the process according the the steps given above. <br>
3) you have to check if the chosen font in the {subtitle preview} is as
you like and if the text fills the black background but not doesn't
exceeds the borders. You have to adjust the special SUP-values
according to the Project X documentation. <br>
+ take into consideration that the position of the subtitles within the
picture depends on the resolution of the picture file. The default
values fit the common D1 standard of 720*576. <br>
4) in ifoedit you have to load the video file, audio file,
subtitle-file ( xyz[X].sup ) and optionally a chapter file and finally
compile this with {ok} to a DVD file structure. <br>
5) the created .IFO-files have default color values for menus and
subtitles. These have to be adjusted to the teletext colors. <br>
+ additionally to the created .IFOs you have to load a COLORS.IFO (if
existing) with the 'new' colors. In the menu VTS_PGCITI choose the
entry VTS_PGC_1 and
in the ifoedit-menu the entry {subtitle colors} {copy colors..},
otherwise you have to set all color-values manually. <br>
+ you have to choose the same entry in the new VTS_xx_0.IFO, but
instead of {copy...} choose {paste colors...}! These changes have to be
saved in this .IFO. <br>
6) the created title set has to be burned on a -RW and tested with your
standalone DVD-player. </p>
  <><u>Particularities:</u> <br>
1) the SUP and the SSA format take the text colors as far as possible
from the teletext. There are only 4 colors valid In the SUP format for
each occurance (mostly half-transparent text-background included),
this might cause differences in the result. From the V.081.6 int10
onwards fonts, which are not provided with a black background are
displayed in Italic (if supported by the font) to state the difference.<br>
2) Synchronization: (see Preconditions 3) <br>
+ the results are (very) differently dependent on the station and page<br>
+ because of missing data it's impossible for the stations: Kabel1,
NDR, ... <br>
Comment: the teletext output was reworked in V.081.7 and should be as
synchrony as the live output (including cuts) provided that correct
insertions are made into the appropriate DPC's.<br>
3) please take into account the subtitles are protected by copyright. <br>

  <p><b><font color="#009900">2.) I have a 2 audio channel record from
e.g.
Worldnet, a audio description e.g. from 3sat or a recording where only
1 channel is of interest and want to separate the channels.</font></b> </p>
  <p>Therefor we have the tab {audio} and the option {2channel to
2*single}. <br>
This works only with the output format: MPEG-1 Audio
Layer2
48kHz between 112...384kbps. <br>
The bitrate in the new 1 channel files is kept as low but as constant
as possible. <br>
This can be done with all jobs which check a MPEG audio file. <br>
If the target bitrate exceeds valid values the file format is
automatically transformed to stereo. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b><font color="#009900">3.) I have a recording which changes
(many times) between different bitrates and/or mono/stereo. The program
crashes during processing or the result sounds like "Mickey Mouse".</font></b>
  </p>
  <p>Therefor we have the tab {audio} and the option {single to ....}. <br>
If you want a stereo file you have to chose the option {single to
jointstereo}
or {single to jointstereo}. <br>
With these options the mono parts are transformed to (2 times mono).
The output file is then created with a constant bitrate over the full
length (if necessary also the stereo parts). <br>
This works only with the output format: MPEG-1 Audio
Layer2
48kHz between 56...192kbps. <br>
This can be done with all jobs which check a MPEG audio file. </p>
  <p>If a mono-file is sufficient you can chose the option {2channel to
2*single}. <br>
Mono parts are copied directly and the bitrate is adjusted if
necessary. 2 channel parts are transformed as described. </p>
  <p>If the recording contains non supported frames the whole
transformation is not performed. <br>
Instead this can be achieved via transformation to PCM. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b><font color="#009900">4.) I have a (S)VCD with a lot of errors</font></b>
  </p>
  <p>Project X is made for DVB data primarily. <br>
(S)VCD contains MPEG data, but in a special CD-XA container
especially made for portable media. These must be extracted before.<br>
You might have to deactivate the {get only enclosed PES packs..} option
in {specials2}. <br>
(S)VCDs according to the jap./amerik. standard are not yet supported. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b><font color="#009900">5.) I have a PVA-Recording with a lot of
audio errors (inserts) in the 'mainstream'. I don't recognize errors
during play.</font></b> </p>
  <p>Your have to activate the {strictly PVA specs for Audio..} option
in {specials2}. <br>
If there can't be found any audio stream the recording application
created a non-standard PVA audio stream. <br>
If the errors occour with activated option then the recording
application produces a non-standard PVA audio stream but this can be
worked around with deactivating this option. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b><font color="#009900">6.) I have a PVA-Recording with several
audio stream with a lot of error (inserts). But only in the additional
stream the main audio stream is o.k.</font></b> </p>
  <p>First click {i} in the main window. <br>
Then you have to choose one ID after the other (of the additional
streams) and save them in a new file. <br>
Then add these new files to the collection and start the job again. <br>
The additional audio stream in the PVA file should be deselected before
processing. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b><font color="#009900">7.) I have a TS-Recording where the job
stops with the message "PID scrambled,
ignored", but this recording is not scrambled.</font></b> </p>
  <p>Deactivate {ignore scrambled TS packets} in {specials1}. X looks
anyway for unscrambled packets for processing. </p>
  <p>If the message "PID xyz
(payload
...) -&gt; ignored" is given while parsing an expected PID, you have to
enter these and any other PIDs you want in the {PIDlist}
in {collection specials}.&nbsp; Then X is searching these PIDs for
usable data.<br>
Even if the TS-Pakets contain scrambled data from time to time, but the
pakets are not marked as "scrambled", the search doesn't ignore these
pakets until well known startcodes are recoknized which cause a stop. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b><font color="#009900">8.) I have a radio recording which has
disturbances. While demuxing these parts are filled with silence or
something like that for synchronization. Can this behavior be disabled?</font></b>
  </p>
  <p>Activate the option {take only 1st audio PTS...} in {specials2}.
Then these parts are ignored without further compensation. <br>
