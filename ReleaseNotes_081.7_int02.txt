changelog:
-fix: exception when audio processing ends w/o found audio
-fix: exception while parsing PMT on short scan 
-fix: exception while processing an ignored ID (vdr,mpg)
-fix: preview get lost with black screen on some bad data
-fix: bitrate monitor - graphical update w/o process
-fix: subpicture .sup format - wrong entries for rectangle size
-new: tab <options> {garbage collector} - set free blocked memory (if automatic doesn't work..)
-new: tab <msg> - now collects the options that affect logwindow messages
-new: logwindow color change when user cancel active process (like pause or error)
-new: teletext - teletext page matrix builds a graphical overview of all found text pages when demux a teletext stream
-changed: audio resampling - function now applies to double value of a sample (instead of rounded int)
-changed: tab <specials> - contents re-arranged and/or moved to other tabs
-changed: <coll. specials> - contents re-arranged +
  * preview window is now CIF-sized and widescreen, to show the right aspectratio
  * shows more details of stream headers
  * slider is wider, incl. a color representation of non-/export areas above when cut (bytepos. cut mode)
-changed: tab <teletext> to <subtitle> - now carries all dvb subtitle settings
-changed: teletext - czech and polish char's added, using unicode +
  * mapping to the correct local char's depends on the installed codepage/font (e.g. 'lucida sans') !
-changed: teletext - .sup export modified, read following:
-new: basic DVB subpicture support added, from PS or TS, only demux but with .sup or .son(+bmp) creation
  hints:
  * there exist several methods of transmission and displaying, basically each language has its own stream and/or page ID (which can be pre-selected by X), all coded as bitmaps (X decodes strings as well, but export isn't yet implemented)
  * a provider can (and do) re-define the basic colors+transparencies of the std decoder model, with up to 256 entries
  * to create .sup or .son, the color table(s) must be mapped to a 16 color table (but with up to 4 colors per picture only)
  * now, each exported .sup file comes along with its relating .sup.IFO, carrying the color indices for authoring (copy/paste). there is no std color.ifo anymore, same for teletext sources !
  * extracting more than one teletext page per job from one streamfile, the latest .sup.IFO carries the indices for all pages before, so use this one.
  * .son format builds for each picture entry one .bmp-256 (may not deal with nonPAL sources)
  * examples for reasonable results as .sup/.son (short tests) whose keep the 'basic look' :
    - NRK nor: decoder model = 4 colors, page ID = 1 (16 colors re-defined) 
    - YLE fin: decoder model = 16colors, page ID = 1 (9 colors re-defined)
    - note: exporting .bmp with min. 16colors always looks better, but cannot be authored 'as is'.
    - on preview and .bmp, 'dark blue (RGB 0,0,0x60)' represents a pixel of full transparency (usually color table index 0) from DVB subpic's
-note: the new features possibly require a lower I/O buffer !
