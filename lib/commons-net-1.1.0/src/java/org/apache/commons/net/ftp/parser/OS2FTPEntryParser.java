/**
 * This Class uses the ListParser class to validate the input string.

 *
 *
 * <P><B>USAGE:</B></P>
 * <LI>Create an instance of OS2FTPEntryParser</LI>
 *   <dd>OS2FTPEntryParser parser = new OS2FTPEntryParser();
 * <LI>Create an instance of FTPClient</LI>
 *   <dd>FTPClient FTPClientObj = new FTPClient();
 * <LI>Connect to the NODE </LI>
 *   <dd>FTPClientObj.connect();
 * <LI>Login to the NODE </LI>
 *   <dd>FTPClientObj.login(username,password);
 * <LI>Switch directories if you have to</LI>
 *   <dd>FTPClientObj.changeWorkingDirectory(thePath);
 * <LI>You might want to check if you are truly in a OS2 System</LI>
 *   <dd><B>String am_I_OS2 =  FTPClientObj.getSystemName()</B>
 *    <dd>parse am_I_OS2 to find out
 * <LI>Call listFiles passing the newly created parser and a filename or a mask 
 * to look for </LI>
 *   <dd>FTPClientObj.listFiles(parser,filename);
 * <LI>You'll get back the list as an array of FTPFiles like this
 *   <dd>FTPFile[] myOS2Files = FTPClientObj.listFiles(parser,filename);  (or)
 *    <dd>FTPFile[] myOS2Files = FTPClientObj.listFiles(parser);
 * <P>
 * That's all there is to it.
 * <P>
 * Each FTPFile object is populated just like any other FTPFile
 * object. The only thing not implemented at this time is the file
 * permissions, but I can do it if there is a real need for it.
 * <P>
 * !NOTE/WARNING!:Before you pass the parser to listFiles, make sure you are 
 * in the directory that you need to be. This parser will return the filtered
 * files from the directory it is in. This becomes specially crucial if your
 * goal is to delete the output of the parser.
