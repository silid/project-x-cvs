/**
 * FTPFileList.java
 * This class encapsulates a listing of files from an FTP server.  It is
 * initialized with an input stream which is read and the input split into
 * lines, each of which (after some possible initial verbiage) represents
 * a file on the FTP server.  A parser is also supplied, which is used to
 * iterate through the internal list of lines parsing each into an FTPFile
 * object which is returned to the caller of the iteration methods.  This
 * parser may be replaced with another, allowing the same list to be parsed
 * with different parsers.
 * Parsing takes place on an as-needed basis, basically, the first time a
 * position is iterated over.  This happens at the time of iteration, not
 * prior to it as the older <code>(FTPClient.listFiles()</code> methods did,
 * which required a bigger memory hit.
